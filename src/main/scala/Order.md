Here's the recommended order in which you should implement the languages:

* First              - A simple arithmetic language
* let.Let            - First, extended with let statements
* print.PrintStdOut  - First, extended with print statements
* print.PrintCollect - Like PrintStdOut, but with a twist
* print.LetAndPrint  - Contains both Let and Print
* print.Statements   - Contains Let, Print, and statement blocks.
* functions.HOF      - Let, and first class functions
* memory.Memory      - Let, statement blocks and memory, with get and set expressions
